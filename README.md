# Mnemonic Cryptography

### Mnemonic is Ä°mage - Based Encryption.

### How is it working
User is adding a picture  anything can happen and Mnemonic it takes the pixel values of the entered image and calculates
it creates a special access code from the picture.

Because the values of each picture will be different.so when decryption you should only have the same picture .


Note:Use an image higher than 72 dpi Otherwise it won't work ...
